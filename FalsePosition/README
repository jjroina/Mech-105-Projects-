Inputs:

func: the function to find the root of
xl: the lower bound of the interval to search for the root
xu: the upper bound of the interval to search for the root
maxit : the maximum number of iterations 
varargin : additional parameters for the function
Outputs:

root: the estimated root of the function
fx: the function value at the estimated root
ea: the approximate relative error (%)
iter: the number of iterations performed
 
False Position is a root finding algorithm used to solve nonlinear equation with one unknown variable. It is an iterative method that starts with two initial guesses of the root, one at the lower end of the interval and one at the upper end. It then computes the intersection of the line segment connecting the two initial guesses with the x-axis.
